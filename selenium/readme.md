Purpose:
This pseudocode would potentially allow a user to test the read status of the twine email client

Dependencies:
Python 2.7.13
PyCharm Community Edition 2016.3.3 - Used due to ease of integration with selenium projects - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac
Selenium

To Run:
- cd to /twine/selenium
- run "python test_client.py" in command line (It will only open the twine home page, as the email client does not exist)
